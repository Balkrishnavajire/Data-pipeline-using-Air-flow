# Data-pipeline-using-Air-flow

This project aims to automate the process of extracting data from Twitter, transforming it into a usable format, and storing it in a cloud-based storage solution. The primary tools used are Python for data extraction and transformation, and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration.

## Problem Statement

Manually extracting and processing large amounts of Twitter data can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses this issue by automating the entire process, making it efficient and reliable.

## Project Workflow

### Data Extraction:

Use the tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API.
Fetch tweets based on specific criteria (e.g., user, keyword, hashtag).
Extract relevant information from each tweet (e.g., text, user, date, likes, retweets).

### Data Transformation:

Convert the extracted data into a structured format (e.g., pandas DataFrame).
Clean and preprocess the data as needed (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).

### Data Storage:

Store the transformed data in a cloud-based storage solution (e.g., Amazon S3).

### Workflow Orchestration:

Use Apache Airflow to define and schedule the data pipeline.
Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to visualize the workflow.
Define tasks for each step of the process (extraction, transformation, storage).
Schedule the DAG to run at regular intervals.

## Technical Implementation

### Setting Up the Environment:

Create an AWS account and launch an EC2 instance.
Install Python and required libraries (tweepy, pandas, s3fs) on the EC2 instance.
Configure the Twitter API credentials.
Install Apache Airflow and configure its web server.

### Writing the Python Script:

Define a Python function to extract data from Twitter using the tweepy library.
Transform the extracted data into a pandas DataFrame.
Write the DataFrame to a CSV file or directly to an S3 bucket.

### Creating the Airflow DAG:

Define a DAG with tasks for each step of the process.
Use PythonOperator to execute the Python script.
Configure the DAG's schedule and dependencies.

### Deploying the DAG:

Upload the Python script to the EC2 instance.
Trigger the DAG from the Airflow web interface.

### Benefits of Automation

#### Efficiency: Automated data extraction and processing saves time and effort.
#### Reliability: Scheduled execution ensures timely data updates.
#### Scalability: The pipeline can be easily scaled to handle increasing data volumes.
#### Reproducibility: The automated process can be easily repeated and modified.
#### Insights: The stored data can be used for data analysis and insights.
